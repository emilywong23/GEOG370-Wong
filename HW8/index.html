    <h2>Homework 8: Pollution and Conservation within Loudoun County, VA</h2>
    <h2> Research Question: Is point source pollution prevalent on conservtaion easements in Loudoun County, Virginia? Additionally, are the majority of point sources located in the nearby vicinity of bodies of water? </h2>
     <h3>This map shows various different factors relating to pollution as well as conservation. First, all of the designated conservation easements in Loudoun County, Virginia are included on the map in green polygons. I then dissolved these parcels together to eliminate unnecessary boundaries between bordering conservation easements, since the parcel boundaries do not impact the spread of pollution. Next, using data downloaded from the Loudoun County Open Data website, I imported all pollution sources within Loudoun County and added a 0.5 mile buffer around each point, since pollution does not tend to stay in one place. I then intersected these pollution points with the conservation easements, and eliminated any pollution points that were not located in a conservation easement. Next, I uploaded a shapefile of the water bodies in Loudoun County, and intersected these with the conservation easements. I was particularily interested in adding the water bodies because of the ability for streams to quickly disperse pollution over a larger area than just the point source, as well as because I wanted to see which water bodies are conserved/protected (yet still might carry pollution). The resulting map showed that the majority of conservation easements with a pollution point lied mainly in Western Loudoun. I was expecting there not to be many conservation easements that had point source pollution, however I was proven wrong. This seems somewhat contradictory since the purpose of these land parcels is to conserve the natural environment, and pollution tends to do the exact opposite. If i were to continue working on this map, I would look into each point source and see what exactly it is, as maybe many could be farmers that use fertilizer? Overall, the resulting map is somewhat unnerving considering conservation and pollution are usually opposites.  </h3> </br>
