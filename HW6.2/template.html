    <h2> Percent of Hispanic People in Poverty in NC (2019 ACS Census Data)</h2>
     <h3> I obtained this data from the 2019 ACS data on poverty in the United States. Specifically, I focused on the number of people in poverty in North Carolina counties. The data set included the amount of people in poverty by race or ethnicity by county. Using this data, I divided the number of Hispanic people in poverty in NC by the total number of people in poverty in NC to create my ratio. This ratio is useful for determining the different percentages of Hispanic people in North Carolina for each county, and comparing these percentages across the state.. </h3> </br>
     <h4> This map is using a quantile classification, which is useful for showing rankings. In this example, the quantile classification makes sure that there are approximately the same amount of counties within each percentage range, which presents a majority of the counties from being put in the same percentile range, which may make the map more difficult to interpret. Quantile classification allows for the data to be more equally distributed across the range of data. </h4> </br>

      <h4> This map is using natural breaks classification, which is useful for grouping the data into real classes based on the trends in the data. This groups similar classes together and then attempts to maximize the differences between data. For this map, natural breaks is useful for depicting how many counties fall into each percentiles, as well as putting the counties into categories that best apply to the mean of the data. This classification is good at grouping similar values together.</h4> </br>
